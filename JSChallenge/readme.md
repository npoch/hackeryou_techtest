In order to succeed in HackerYou's part-time Fundamentals of JavaScript class, students should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Successful applicants should understand at least one CSS Layout technique and should have an in-depth understanding of HTML attributes and why they are important when building websites.

To demonstrate understanding of the criteria above, please recreate the image provided (techChallenge.png) as a website, as closely as possible. 

Instructions:
- Recreate the image provided (techChallenge.png) as a website, as closely as possible.
- Code the project from scratch; the use of Bootstrap or any other library with pre-built code is not allowed.
- Use floats, flexbox, or grid for layout. 
- The website DOES *NOT* need to be responsive. 
- Ensure the form elements have all the proper attributes.
- Use an HTML image element for the image, NOT a background image (this asset is provided).
- The following are enhancements. We'd like to see at least one included in your final implementation:
	- Change the colour of the placeholder text.
	- Make the 'Last Name' field required.
	- Restrict the phone number to be 10 digits.

When you are finished, please rename your project folder to include your name and HY-JS-Challenge (example: janeSmith-HY-JS-Challenge). Please zip up your folder and send it back.
